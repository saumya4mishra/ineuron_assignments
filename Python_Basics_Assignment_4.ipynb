    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "list and string data type are quite identical. on one hand string is a lists are collection of bytes representing unicode characters whereas list is a collection of heterogeneous data types.\n",

    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "major difference between lists and tuples is that lists are muable collection of heterogeneous data whereas, tuples are immutable. In simpler terms, data in lists can be modifies on the other hand its not possible for tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "list are defined using [], whereas tuples are defined using ()\n",

    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign a list to a variable, you are actually assigning a list reference to the variable. A reference is a value that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> cheese = spam\n",
    ">>> cheese[1] = 'Hello!'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "here we can see any changes made in cheese variable also reflects in spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create the list, you assign a reference to it in the spam variable. But the next line copies only the list reference in spam to cheese, not the list value itself. This means the values stored in spam and cheese now both refer to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import copy\n",

    ">>> cheese = copy.copy(spam)\n",

    "['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n",
    ">>> cheese\n",
    "['A', 42, 'C', 'D']\n",
    "\n",
    " copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference. Now the spam and cheese variables refer to separate lists, which is why only the list in cheese is modified when you assign 42 at index 1.\n",
    " \n",
    "If the list you need to copy contains lists, then use the copy.deepcopy() function instead of copy.copy(). The deepcopy() function will copy these inner lists as well."
