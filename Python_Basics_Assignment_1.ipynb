    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "String is a data type which are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters such as 'saumya', \"ineuron\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable is the named reference to the memory loaction where data is stored suc as   my_name = 'saumya'\n",
    "\n",
    "so, my_name is the reference using which I can access my data i.e 'saumya'\n",
    "\n",
    "here 'saumya' is a type of data which is string\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "String: String is a data type which are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters such as 'saumya', \"ineuron\"\n",
    "\n",
    "strings are enclosed inside single or double colens 'saumya' or \"mishra\"\n",
    "\n",
    "strings are immutable which means we cannot modify the value of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "my_name = 'saumya'\n",
    "my_name[2] = 'k'\n",
    "\n",
    "this will give error that strings are immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "List: List is a data type which is a collection of heterogeneous data, lists are mutable i.e elements of the lists can be  modeified as and when required. e.g\n",
    "\n",
    "l_mylist = ['name', 1234, 3 + 4j, True, 40.9887]\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data type is a list which are always enclosed between square braces []. It can hold multiple data types with mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets: Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "sets are enclosed inside curved brackets {}\n",
    "sets are iteratable but we cannot do slicing on sets\n",
    "sets are even unordered\n",
    "sets has no duplicate elements\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, an expression is any legal combination of symbols (like a variable, constants, and operators) representing a value. An expression must have at least one operand (variable or constant) and have one or more operators. After evaluating an expression, we get a value as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, x+y*z-8 is an example of an expression, where +, * are operators; x, y, and z are variables, and 8 is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the operand is the value on which the operator is applied, and operators use constants and variables to form an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions only contain identifiers, literals and operators, where operators include arithmetic and boolean operators, the function call operator () the subscription operator [] and similar. The output of an expression is some kind of \"value\", which can be any Python object. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "3 + 5\n",
    "map(lambda x: x*x, range(10))\n",
    "[a.x for a in some_iterable]\n",
    "yield 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements on the other hand, are everything that can make up a line (or several lines) of Python code. Note that expressions are statements as well. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "print 42\n",
    "if x: do_y()\n",
    "return\n",
    "a = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon still contains 22 since bacon + 1 is not assigned to bacon itself however\n",
    "if the 2nd statement would've been \n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "then bacon would contain 23\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",

    "\n",
    "every variable defined must follow the below rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n",
    "A variable name cannot start with a number.\n",
    "A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).\n",
    "The reserved words (keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "eggs is a valid variable name since it follows the above rules while,\n",
